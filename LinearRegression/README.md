## Project Descriptions

#### Airfoil Self_Noise Dataset - Regression Problem
Airfoil self_noise dataset is a dataset NASA data set, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel. Using the attributes given, the atmospheric Pressure Levels are predicted using:
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest
